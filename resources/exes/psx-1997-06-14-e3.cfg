# This build contains many entities which fail to load. All of the ones listed below are considered intentionally "unfixed".
# - CAV_FROGGER_LIGHT (CAV1.MAP) (Read: 52, Real: 48). This entity appears in other maps and seems fine in the other maps. As such, it seems that CAV1.MAP may just be an older entity definition than the one in build #1.
# - CAV_SPIDER (CAV3, CAV5.MAP). It seems like these maps are old and contain STATIC spider entities, instead of MOVING ones.
# - SUB_BUTTERFLY & SUB_BUTTERFLY2 (DES34, FOR12345, JUN12345, ARN12345, VOL12345, SUB3, ISLAND). There seem to be three separate entity definitions here. (SUB3: Path data, 12 bytes), (ISLAND.MAP: 32 bytes static), (Other: 24 bytes, unknown). I've chosen to stick with what the formbook in the executable says, which is compatible with ISLAND.MAP.
# - QB.MAP:
#  - Entity Type #1 is seen as a JETTY, and Entity Type #2 is seen as a SUB_LORRY.
#  - Both of these are path followers, but the exact models seen here are probably incorrect.
#  - This map seems to be using an extremely old form library, since it's extremely unlikely that the JETTY entity was intended to follow a path.
#  - Modifications would need to be made exclusively for this level

# The configurations for this build (entity, form, data, etc) have been vetted / appear to be correct.
# However, sound effect ids in game scripts are wrong. It seems like they're wrong in the actual game though. Eg: They didn't recompile after adding a new sound to the enum.
# A couple of scripts fail to load too, but overall the script names should be correct.

# All of the placeholder maps (DES3/4, FOR1-5, JUN1-5, ARN1-5, SKY3/4, VOL1-5) seem to also be using a slightly outdated MAP_GROUP format.
